While music generation is a relatively well-explored field of deep learning, most generators are limited to generating notes of static length and timing for the piano strictly. In order to build a more compelling and robust music generation model, we divide our task into two main segments: music classification and music generation. Despite limited time to accomplish the latter, we reached interesting results from a musical standpoint, and in doing so managed to build a LSTM-based RNN that is quite effective at predicting the next note in sequences of trumpet soloist music.
